# Stretch microarchitecture plan: from ISA model to the real machine

Written 2026-09-03 on the owner's instruction: *"make the microarchitecture
the same as the original stretch, this includes pipelining and the other
tricks they did."* This supersedes the founding scope statement in
`bsv/README.md` ("ISA-level correctness, not the famous pipelined
microarchitecture"). Everything the project built up to this point --
the STRAP assembler, the listing oracle, and above all the suite of
verbatim 1961 diagnostic programs -- becomes the correctness oracle for
the rewrite.

## 1. What "the same as the original" means here

The 7030 was built from ~170,000 transistors in current-mode logic with
ECC on every memory word and parity on every internal register. The
model will reproduce the machine at the level its own designers
described it: the functional units, their registers and buses, the
buffering between them, the interlocks that keep out-of-sequence
execution invisible, branch guessing and recovery, and the cycle timing
of each unit. It will not reproduce gate-level logic, physical clock
distribution, or the error-checking hardware's *content* -- ECC and
parity checking are modeled as the pipeline stages they occupied (the
"I checker" takes a cycle whether or not there is an error), with error
*correction* itself out of scope until a diagnostic needs it.

Concretely, "the same" means these things, each with a primary source:

| Aspect | Real machine | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Memory | 16,384-word units, 2.1 µs read-write cycle, each with its own addressing and data registers; typical system 6 units: 4 interleaved (consecutive addresses in different units) for data + 2 interleaved for instructions | Buchholz ch.14 §14.1 (p.202); Blosk fig.1 |
| Memory bus control unit (MBCU) | Arbitrates 8 requesters with priority exchange > disk > look-ahead > instruction unit; accepts one store/fetch per 0.3 µs; returns a word ~1.6 µs after request when the unit is free; holds requests for busy units; each request carries a 3-bit return address (which Y register or LA level) | Buchholz §14.3 (pp.205-206); Blosk p.19 |
| Instruction unit (I-box) | ICR (19 bits) with +2 adder giving n..n+3; two 64-bit instruction/data buffers 1Y, 2Y; index storage: 17-word × 73-bit core array (word 17 = timer/clock) with one data register XR; preparation/execution register ZR (64 bits + 3-bit P for progressive indexing); working register WR (19 bits); 24-bit index adder with in-buses A (IC, WR, XR, ZR, complementable) and B (Y registers, ZR); shared I checker; up to six instructions in progress | Blosk TR00.722 pp.7-15, fig.3 |
| I-box responsibilities | Fetches and checks every instruction; indexes (normal and progressive); pre-decodes; executes index arithmetic, branches, transmit and misc itself; initiates operand fetches for FP/VFL and loads them into look-ahead; monitors all addresses against the boundary registers; runs the interrupt mechanism; steps the timer/clock | Blosk pp.4-6, Appendix B |
| Branch guessing | Conditional branches on arithmetic results are assumed *not* taken; the I-box continues; index-indicator branches (CB family, B on XF/XVLZ/XVZ/XVGZ/XCZ/XL/XE/XH) are resolved in the I-box from an "updated indicator register" of eight triggers | Buchholz §14.3 p.207, §15.2 p.238; Blosk p.17; Perf. Char. vol.1 p.3-22 |
| Look-ahead (LA) | Four levels, each: op code, 8 tag bits (level filled, level checked, internal operand, IC valid, LA op code, word-boundary crossover, no-op, from), 15 indicators, instruction counter, 64-bit operand; five ring counters (instruction-unit, operand-check, transfer-bus, arithmetic-bus, store-check) advancing under interlocks; one look-ahead address register (LAAR) with forwarding; all stores to memory and internal registers performed by LA; index-recovery pseudo-store levels; recovery ("housecleaning") on interrupt or wrong-way branch | Buchholz ch.15 §15.3-15.6 (pp.238-247), figs 15.6-15.10 |
| Arithmetic unit (E-box) | Serial unit (VFL add/subtract, connectives, FP exponent) and parallel unit (FP fraction add/multiply/divide, VFL multiply/divide), sharing the 128-bit accumulator A/B and 128-bit operand register C/D; slave to LA (receives op + operand, signals termination, returns store results to LA); basic cycle 0.3 µs | Buchholz §14.4 (pp.208-216); Perf. Char. vol.1 ch.3 |
| Timing | E-box cycle 0.3 µs; I-box control cycle 0.5 µs as designed (Blosk p.23) and 0.6 µs as shipped (Perf. Char. p.3-17: "decoding time of I-box instructions is 0.6 µs", table entries in multiples of 0.6); FP preparation one instruction per 1.2 µs; VFL preparation 3.6 µs minimum loading two LA levels, +0.6 per extra level or indexing; per-instruction pre-execution/execution cycle counts | Perf. Char. vol.1 ch.3 tables 2-9; Blosk figs 6-10 |
| Clocks | Units asynchronous with respect to each other, synchronous within; one master oscillator | Buchholz §14.2 p.204; Blosk p.21 |

## 2. Where the current model stands

`bsv/` today is a single non-pipelined core (`StretchCore.step()`):
fetch, decode completely, execute one instruction to completion (with
multi-cycle bail/resume for BRAM reads, a two-step index write, and an
I/O transfer FSM), then the next. Storage is one BRAM behind a
request/response interface. There is no instruction buffering, no
overlap, no look-ahead, no separate arithmetic unit, no timing. It is
architecturally correct for everything the 20-block suite covers, and
that correctness is what the rewrite must preserve at every stage.

What carries over unchanged: `StretchDecode.bsv` (field extraction),
`StretchALU.bsv`/`StretchVFL.bsv` (arithmetic on operands already in
registers), the assembler, the testbench generator's checks, and the
programs. What is replaced: `StretchCore.bsv` and the control structure
of `StretchExecute.bsv`. What is added: the units in §3.

## 3. Target structure (Bluespec modules)

```

Cycle base: one Bluespec clock = one E-box cycle = 0.3 µs. Units that
are asynchronous in the real machine are modeled as separately-clocked
FSMs on that common base (I-box control stages advance every 2 clocks;
a memory unit is busy for 7 clocks; the MBCU accepts one request per
clock). A global cycle counter exposed to the testbench gives every run
a time, and per-unit trace output (`$display` under a flag) gives the
same view Blosk's figures 6-10 draw.

## 4. Stages, each ending green on the full suite

The order follows the data: memory first (everything else waits on it),
then the unit that drives everything (I-box), then the buffering between
I-box and E-box (look-ahead), then splitting execution. Each stage is a
separate commit series with the full `run_tests.sh` suite green before
the next begins; the suite checks only architectural results, so a
stage that changes timing but not results is exactly what "green"
should mean.

**Stage 0 -- observability.** Add the cycle counter, a `PC=`-style
`CYCLES<=` bound check to `gen_tb.py`, and a per-unit trace flag. No
behavior change. (Small; lets every later stage report its timing.)

**Stage 1 -- memory units and the MBCU.** Replace `StretchStorage`'s
single BRAM with six `mkMemoryUnit`s behind `mkMBCU`: interleave map
(4-way over the data block, 2-way over the instruction block, per
Buchholz §14.1), per-unit busy for 7 clocks, priority arbitration,
return tags, and the request/response latency the rest of the machine
sees (~5 clocks when free). The 0-31 special-register words stay
register-backed inside the CPU (they are, on the real machine: index
storage and internal transistor registers -- Blosk p.19). The existing
core keeps working with a longer, variable memory latency; its
bail/resume design already tolerates that.

**Stage 2 -- the instruction unit.** New `mkInstructionUnit` replacing
the core's fetch/decode/step loop: ICR with n..n+3 addressing; 1Y/2Y
buffers filled ahead by the IC controls; I checker stage; Y-to-Z
transfer with the half-word criss-cross that aligns full-word
instructions; index storage as a 17-entry array with its 1-cycle read
and 2-cycle write through XR; ZR/P/WR; the index adder; pre-decoding
and the tag triggers; execution of the I-box instruction classes
(Blosk Appendix B: index arithmetic, branches, transmit, misc, SIC);
the updated indicator register for I-box-resolved branches; the
not-taken guess for arithmetic-conditional branches. At this stage the
E-box-class instructions (VFL, FP, connectives, I/O) are still executed
in order by the old execute path fed from ZR, so the suite must stay
green while instruction fetch and I-box execution become real.
Timing target: Blosk fig.6 (FP preparation one per two I-box cycles),
fig.8 (CB in six cycles), Perf. Char. tables 4-9 for I-box instruction
times.

**Stage 3 -- the look-ahead.** `mkLookAhead` with four levels of the
exact register set (op code, 8 tags, 15 indicators, IC, operand), the
five ring counters with the interlocks of Buchholz figs 15.7-15.10,
the LAAR with forwarding and store-close-to-fetch handling (Perf. Char.
pp.3-20..3-21: prefetched-instruction invalidation, delayed operand,
forwarding), all stores routed through LA, index-recovery pseudo-store
levels for every I-box instruction, and recovery/housecleaning on
interrupt and on wrong-way branch (I-box IC and index registers
restored from LA, intervening operations cancelled). The old execute
path becomes the consumer of LA levels. This is the largest stage and
the one the suite's SIC/CB/branch programs exercise hardest: every
verbatim I-Box 1 group is a sequence of I-box branches interleaved
with LA-loaded operations, and the p.50-51 SIC groups in particular
store into instructions that have just been prefetched.

**Stage 4 -- the arithmetic unit.** Split execution into the serial
and parallel units with A/B and C/D, driven by LA's transfer-bus
counter and reporting termination to the arithmetic-bus counter;
pre-execution vs. execution cycle accounting per Perf. Char. table 2
(FP) and the VFL tables; VFL word-boundary-crossover operands
arriving in two LA levels. Floating-point arithmetic beyond L/ST
(unimplemented today) is added here, since the parallel unit's timing
is the reason the machine exists.

**Stage 5 -- timing validation.** Reproduce Perf. Char. vol.1 ch.4's
worked timing examples and vol.2's benchmark programs (STRAP source
with measured times) as tests with `CYCLES<=` bounds; compare Blosk's
figures 6-10 against the trace output cycle by cycle.

Deferred, in scope, after stage 5: the interrupt system as a whole
(indicator/mask/left-most-one, the "free instruction"), boundary
protection alarms, the timer/clock stepping through index storage word
17, the exchange as an MBCU requester with real overlap (the current
synchronous I/O FSM is a stage-1 compatibility path).

## 5. Oracles and how each stage is verified

1. **Architectural**: `strap/run_tests.sh` -- 20 blocks, ~600 listing
   rows, seven verbatim diagnostic programs with the deck's own pass/
   fail mechanisms. Green before every commit, as now.
2. **Discriminating checks for the microarchitecture**: programs whose
   *result* depends on the machine doing the trick correctly rather
   than merely fast -- store-into-prefetched-instruction (the SIC
   groups already do this; add Perf. Char.'s three "store close to
   fetch" sequences as programs), forwarding (`LOAD a; MULTIPLY a;
   MULTIPLY a` per Buchholz §15.4), wrong-way branch recovery with
   index registers modified by prefetched I-box instructions, and
   interrupt recovery once interrupts exist.
3. **Timing**: `CYCLES<=` bounds from Perf. Char. tables, Blosk's
   diagrams, and vol.2's measured benchmarks. Timing checks are
   separate from architectural checks so a timing regression cannot
   masquerade as a correctness failure or vice versa.
4. **Bug injection** stays the rule: every interlock gets a test that
   fails when the interlock is removed (e.g. remove the instruction-
   unit-counter/store-check interlock and watch a store be lost).

## 6. Known risks

- **bsc scheduling.** The single-rule `step()` design was chosen partly
  because bsc rejected same-rule combinations of storage and index
  writes (README "Toolchain" item 7). Six concurrently firing units
  with shared buses will need explicit arbitration modules and FIFOs/
  RWires rather than one big rule; expect to rediscover G0004
  conflicts early in stage 2 and design the buses as modules with
  single-writer methods from the start.
- **Fidelity vs. documentation gaps.** Blosk's report predates the
  shipped machine (0.5 µs vs 0.6 µs I-box cycle); where Buchholz,
  Blosk and Performance Characteristics disagree, the 1961
  Performance Characteristics (measured on the built machine) wins
  for timing and the CE manual (1963) wins for structure. Record each
  such choice in this document.
- **Elaboration size.** Four LA levels × 64-bit operands, two Y
  registers, a 17-word index array and six memory units are modest;
  the earlier Vector-of-Reg blowup came from a 256-entry register
  file with dozens of read ports, which none of these are.
- **Suite runtime.** A cycle-level model runs the same programs in more
  simulated cycles; the suite's ~10-minute wall time is dominated by
  bsc compilation, not simulation, so this should stay tolerable.

## 7. Immediate next steps

1. Commit this plan; update `bsv/README.md`'s scope statement and
   `AGENTS.md` to point here.
2. Stage 0 (cycle counter, `CYCLES<=` check, trace flag).
3. Stage 1 (memory units + MBCU), with the existing core as the client.
4. Read CE manual section 3's I-box flow charts before stage 2 and add
   their figure numbers to §3's table.
